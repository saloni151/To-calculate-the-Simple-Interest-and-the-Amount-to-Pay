# Simple Interest Calculator 

This is a simple Python program to calculate **Simple Interest** and the **Total Amount** to be paid based on user inputs.

# Formula Used

**Simple Interest (SI) = (P × R × T) / 100**

Where:
- `P` = Principal amount
- `R` = Rate of interest (per annum)
- `T` = Time (in years)

**Total Amount to Pay = Principal + Simple Interest**
